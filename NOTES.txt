# General thoughts
NOTE: I don't quite yet have the confidence to implement a lot of these yet, questionable design decisions are not intentional
"Known" issues:
 - These async_to_sync/needing to account for dbot is still messy - move to celery tasks for both directions
 - These very likely need to break apart into their own separate django apps
 - Pydantic basemodel to steg model fields is a better idea/route
 - Admin views need to limit options in selectons for objects
 - User view needs to be made
 - Air table/Live match html needs to be made
