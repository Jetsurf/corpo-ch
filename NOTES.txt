# General thoughts
NOTE: I don't quite yet have the confidence to implement a lot of these yet, questionable design decisions are not intentional
"Known" issues:
 - These async_to_sync/needing to account for dbot is still messy - move to celery tasks for both directions
 - Tings very likely need to break apart into their own separate django apps - at a minimum separate Discord model fields from corpoch
 - Pydantic basemodel to steg model fields is a better idea/route
 - Admin views need to limit options in selectons for objects
 - User view needs to be made
 - Air table/Live match html needs to be made
 - Discord bot views should be moved to their own folder to break the file sizes up

File uploads - this should be a heck of a lot cleaner
```
def upload_to(instance, filename):
    return f"uploads/{instance.user.id}/{filename}"

class Profile(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField('auth.User', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    avatar = models.ImageField(upload_to=upload_to)
```
